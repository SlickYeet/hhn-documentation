# Creating a Bootable USB Drive using Ventoy

## Introduction

Ventoy is an open-source tool designed to create bootable USB drives that allow
you to boot multiple ISO files from a single USB drive without the need to
reformat it each time. You simply copy the ISO files onto the USB drive, and
Ventoy presents a menu at boot time to select which ISO to boot from. This makes
it extremely convenient for testing and installing multiple operating systems or
tools from a single USB drive.

### Key Features:

- Boot multiple ISO files from a single USB drive
- No need to format the USB drive repeatedly
