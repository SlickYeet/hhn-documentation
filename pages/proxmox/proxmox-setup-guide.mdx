# Proxmox Setup Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Proxmox Setup Guide! This section will walk you through the
process of setting up your Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), from initial
installation to basic configuration. Proxmox VE is an open-source server
virtualization environment that allows you to manage virtual machines,
containers, and storage solutions efficiently. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A dedicated server or a powerful workstation with at least 4GB of RAM (8GB or
  more recommended).
- A 64-bit processor with VT-x/AMD-V support.
- A stable internet connection.
- Proxmox VE ISO image, which can be downloaded from the
  [Proxmox download page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment).

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Prepare Your Installation Media

1. **Download the Proxmox VE ISO**: Visit the
   [Proxmox download page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment)
   and download the latest version of the Proxmox VE ISO.
2. **Create a Bootable USB Drive**: Using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie). We have a
   guide that covers this setup, step-by-step
   [here](/bootable-usb-drive/creating-a-bootable-usb-drive-using-rufus).

### Boot and Install Proxmox VE

1. **Boot from the USB Drive**: Insert the bootable USB drive into your server
   and boot from it. You may need to adjust the BIOS/UEFI settings to prioritize
   USB boot.
2. **Start the Installation**: Once booted, you'll see the Proxmox VE installer
   boot menu. Select "Install Proxmox VE" and press Enter. **(In this guide we
   will be using the graphical installer.)**
3. **Accept the EULA**: Read and accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).
4. **Select the Target Hard Disk**: Choose the disk where you want to install
   Proxmox VE. Ensure this disk is empty or contains no important data, as it
   will be formatted.
5. **Configure the Country, Time Zone, and Keyboard Layout**: Set your preferred
   country, time zone, and keyboard layout.
6. **Set the Root Password and Email**: Create a strong password for the root
   account and provide an email address for system notifications.
7. **Configure the Network**: Set up the hostname, IP address, netmask, gateway,
   and DNS server. Use a static IP address to avoid network issues later.
8. **Finish the installation**: After completing all previous steps, click the
   **Install** button at the end of the installation wizard to install Proxmox
   VE.

**_NOTE:_** The hostname will be used to identify the node in a cluster, and
should **NOT** be changed after creating guests or joining a cluster. To learn
more about Proxmox clusters click [here](/proxmox/advanced/clustering-proxmox).

### First Boot and Basic Configuration

1. **Reboot the System**: Once the installation is complete, remove the USB
   drive and reboot your server.
2. **Access the Web Interface**: Open a web browser on a device connected to the
   same network and navigate to `https://<your-server-ip>:8006`. Note that the
   connection uses HTTPS and may show a security warning, which you can bypass.
3. **Login to Proxmox VE**: Use the root account and the password you set during
   installation to log in.

### Update Proxmox VE

1. **Update Package Repository**: Open the shell, by navigating to \<NODE_NAME\>
   or SSH into your Proxmox server and run the following commands to update the
   package repository:

   **_NOTE_**: The NODE_NAME is located under `Datacenter` and is derived from
   the hostname set during installation.

   ```bash copy
   apt update
   apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Update Proxmox VE Packages**: Ensure all Proxmox VE packages are up to
   date:
   ```bash copy
   pveupdate
   pveupgrade
   ```

### Configure Storage (Optional)

1. **Add Local Storage**: Navigate to `Datacenter > Storage` in the web
   interface. Add a new local storage for ISO images, backups, and containers.
2. **Add Network Storage**: If you have network-attached storage (NAS), you can
   add it under `Datacenter > Storage` by selecting the appropriate storage type
   (NFS, CIFS, etc.).

### Create Virtual Machines and Containers

1. **Create a Virtual Machine (VM)**: Navigate to `Datacenter > Create VM`.
   Follow the wizard to configure the VM, including selecting an ISO image,
   setting disk size, memory, and CPU resources.
2. **Create a Container (CT)**: Navigate to `Datacenter > Create CT`. Follow the
   wizard to configure the container, choosing the desired OS template and
   resource allocation.

### Backup and Restore (Recommended)

1. **Set Up Backup**: Configure backup jobs under `Datacenter > Backup` to
   automate backups of your VMs and containers.
2. **Restore from Backup**: Use the Restore option under the Storage menu to
   restore VMs and containers from backup files.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You've successfully set up Proxmox VE and are ready to start
creating and managing virtual machines and containers. For advanced
