# Clustering Proxmox with Three Nodes

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide is not fully tested, and subject to change.
</Callout>

## Introduction

Clustering Proxmox provides high availability and load balancing for virtual
machines and containers. With a minimum of three nodes, you can create a
resilient cluster capable of tolerating the failure of a single node without
downtime.

### Why Three Nodes?

Proxmox recommends a minimum of three nodes for a cluster due to several
reasons:

1. **Fault Tolerance**: With three nodes, the cluster can continue operating
   even if one node fails. Each node acts as a redundant backup for the others,
   ensuring that services remain available in the event of hardware failure or
   maintenance.

2. **Quorum Requirement**: Proxmox clusters use a quorum algorithm to ensure
   data integrity and prevent split-brain scenarios. A cluster with an odd
   number of nodes (e.g., three) ensures that there is always a majority to
   establish quorum and make decisions about resource allocation and failover.

3. **Load Distribution**: Three nodes allow for better distribution of virtual
   machines and containers across the cluster. This helps prevent resource
   contention and improves overall performance by spreading the workload evenly.

4. **Scalability**: While three nodes are the minimum for a Proxmox cluster,
   additional nodes can be added for increased scalability and redundancy.
   However, starting with three nodes provides a solid foundation for building a
   resilient infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- **Three Physical Servers**: Each server should meet the minimum hardware
  requirements for Proxmox VE.
- **Proxmox VE ISO**: Download the latest Proxmox VE ISO from the official
  website.
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure that each server has a unique hostname, IP
  address, and is connected to a network accessible by all nodes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Install Proxmox VE on Each Node

If you require assistance with the installation of Proxmox VE, we have a
detailed guide covering the installation process step-by-step
[here](/proxmox/proxmox-setup-guide).

1. Boot each server from the Proxmox VE ISO.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Proxmox VE on each server.
3. Ensure that the network configuration is correctly set up during the
   installation process.

### Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) (Optional)

1. Log in to each Proxmox node via SSH or the console.
2. Edit the NTP configuration file:

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
```

3. Add NTP servers or use the default ones:

```bash copy
NTP=your.ntp.server
```

4. Save and exit the file.
5. Restart the systemd-timesyncd service:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

### Configure Hostname Resolution

1. Edit the hosts file on each node:

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

2. Add entries for each node:

```php copy
<node1_IP>  <node1_hostname>
<node2_IP>  <node2_hostname>
<node3_IP>  <node3_hostname>
```

3. Save and exit the file.

### Set Up SSH Key Authentication

1. Generate an SSH key pair on the first node (replace \<your_email\> with your
   actual email address):

```bash copy
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Copy the public key to the other nodes:

```bash copy
ssh-copy-id user@node2_IP
ssh-copy-id user@node3_IP
```

3. Test SSH access to each node to ensure key authentication works.

### Create Proxmox Cluster

1.  Log in to the Proxmox web interface of one node using a web browser.
2.  Navigate to Datacenter > Cluster.
3.  Click Create Cluster and enter a name for the cluster.
4.  Add the other nodes to the cluster using their IP addresses and SSH
    credentials.
5.  Confirm the addition of each node.

### Verify Cluster Configuration

1. In the Proxmox web interface, navigate to Datacenter > Cluster.
2. Ensure that all nodes are listed and have a status of "online".
3. Verify that shared storage is available and accessible from all nodes.

### Configure High Availability (HA)

1. In the Proxmox web interface, navigate to Datacenter > HA.
2. Click Enable HA and follow the on-screen instructions to configure fencing
   and other settings.
3. Ensure that HA resources are distributed evenly across all nodes.

### Test Failover

<Callout type="default">
  For failover to function correctly, you need to setup shared storage. Proxmox
  supports various storage types, including NFS, Ceph, and iSCSI. We have a
  guide on settings up shared storage with Ceph on Proxmox
  [here](/proxmox/shared-storage-using-ceph).
</Callout>

1. Create a test virtual machine or container on one of the nodes.
2. Simulate a node failure by shutting down or disconnecting one of the nodes.
3. Monitor the Proxmox web interface to ensure that the virtual
   machine/container fails over to another node automatically.
4. Verify that there is no downtime for the virtual machine/container.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've successfully set up a Proxmox cluster with a
minimum of three nodes, providing high availability and resilience to node
failures. You can now deploy and manage virtual machines and containers with
confidence.

Happy virtualizing!
