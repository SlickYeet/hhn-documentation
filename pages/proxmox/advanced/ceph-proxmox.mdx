# Deploy Hyper-Converged Ceph Cluster

## Introduction

In this guide we will deploy a hyper-converged Ceph cluster on a Proxmox VE
cluster. This guide assumes you have a Proxmox VE cluster with at least three
nodes. If you do not have a Proxmox Ve cluster, you can follow our guide on
[Clustering Proxmox](/proxmox/advanced/clustering-proxmox).

This guide will cover the following topics:

- Installing Ceph on Proxmox
- Configuring the Ceph cluster
- Creating a Ceph pool

<Callout type="info">
  This guide will cover the deployment of a hyper-converged Ceph cluster using
  the Proxmox Web UI. If you prefer to use the command line, you can refer to
  the [official Proxmox
  documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Deploy_Hyper-Converged_Ceph_Cluster).
</Callout>

## What is Ceph?

Ceph is a distributed storage system that provides object storage, block
storage, and file storage. Ceph is designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant,
making it an ideal storage solution for cloud environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

- A Proxmox VE cluster with at least three nodes
  [Clustering Proxmox](/proxmox/advanced/clustering-proxmox)
- A dedicated network for Ceph traffic (recommended)
- At least one additional disk per node for Ceph OSDs

## Step by Step Guide

<Steps>

### Install Ceph on Proxmox

<Callout type="warning">
  When installing Ceph on Proxmox without a Proxmox subscription, you will need
  to use the `No Subscription` repository.
</Callout>

To install Ceph on Proxmox, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Proxmox Web UI.
2. Click on the `Datacenter` node in the tree view.
3. Click on the `Ceph` tab.
4. Click on the `Install` button.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ceph on your Proxmox cluster.
   - We will be using `reef (18.2)` as the Ceph version.
   - Click on the Repository drop-down menu, and select the `No Subscription`
     repository.
   - Click on the `Start reef installation` button. This will install Ceph on
     your Proxmox cluster.

<Callout type="info">
  You may be prompted to enter [Y/n] to confirm the installation. Enter `Y` to
  continue.
</Callout>

6. Once the installation is complete, you will be able to click the `Next`
   button. Click on the `Next` button to continue.

### Configure Ceph Cluster

1. On the `Configuring` screen, select a Public Network IP/CIDR and Cluster
   Network IP/CIDR. These networks should be separate from your Proxmox
   management network.
2. If you wish to configure the Number of replicas, and the Minumum replicas,
   tick the `Advanced` checkbox at the bottom of the screen. For this guide, we
   will leave the default settings.
3. Click on the `Next` button to continue.
4. On the `Success` screen, view the next steps, you will need to follow these
   steps to complete the Ceph cluster configuration.
5. Click on the `Finish` button to complete the installation.

<Callout>Repeat the above steps on each node in your Proxmox cluster</Callout>

### Create additional Ceph Monitors

<Callout type="info">
  It is recommended to have an odd number of monitors in your Ceph cluster. For
  this guide, we will be creating three monitors.
</Callout>

1. Click on the Node in the tree view, on which you have installed Ceph.
2. Similarly to the previous steps, click on the `Ceph` drop-down menu, and
   click on the `Monitor` option.
3. Click on the `Create` button.
4. Select a `Host` from the drop-down menu, and click on the `Create` button.
5. Repeat the above steps to create additional monitors for each node in your
   Proxmox cluster.

### Create additional Ceph Managers (Optional)

<Callout type="info">
  This step is optional, but it is recommended to have multiple managers in your
  Ceph cluster for redundancy.
</Callout>

These steps are similar to creating additional monitors.

1. In the same screen where you created the monitors, click on the `Create`
   button, under the `Manager` section.
2. Select a `Host` from the drop-down menu, and click on the `Create` button.
3. Repeat the above steps to create additional managers for each node in your
   Proxmox cluster.

### Create Ceph OSDs

<Callout type="warning">
  You must have at least one OSD per node in your Ceph cluster, and it is
  recommended to have multiple OSDs per node for redundancy.

For this guide, we will be creating one OSD per node. You can create additional
OSDs by following the same steps.

</Callout>

If you have added additional Managers, you can configure Ceph from any Node in
your Proxmox cluster. Otherwise, you will need to configure Ceph from the Node
where you have installed Ceph initially.

1. Click on the Node in the tree view, which is your Ceph Manager.
2. Click on the `Ceph` drop-down menu, and click on the `OSD` option.
3. Click on the `Create: OSD` button.
4. Select a disk from the `Disk` drop-down menu, on which you want to create the
   OSD.
5. If you wish to configure a different `DB Disk` for the OSD, you can select a
   disk from the `DB Disk` drop-down menu.

   <Callout type="info">
     For this guide, we will leave this option as `use OSD disk`. Additionally
     we will leave the `Advanced` options as default. For more information on
     these options, you can refer to the [official Proxmox
     documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Deploy_Hyper-Converged_Ceph_Cluster).
   </Callout>

6. Click on the `Create` button to create the OSD.

### Create CephFS and Metadata Servers (Optional)

To create a CephFS, you can follow these steps:

1. Click on the Node in the tree view, which is your Ceph Manager.
2. Click on the `Ceph` drop-down menu, and click on the `CephFS` option.
3. Click on the `Create CephFS` button.
4. Enter a `Name` for the CephFS, and configure the options as required. This
   guide will not cover the configuration of these options.
5. Click on the `Create` button.

If you wish to configure Metadata Servers, you can do so by following these
steps:

1. On the same screen where you created the CephFS, click on the `Create` button
   under the `Metadata Servers` section.
2. Select a `Host` from the drop-down menu, and Enter an `Extra ID` for the
   Metadata Server.
3. Click on the `Create` button.

### Create Ceph Pools

Lastly, you must create a Ceph pool to store your data. Don't worry you are
almost there!

1. Click on the Node in the tree view, which is your Ceph Manager.
2. Click on the `Ceph` drop-down menu, and click on the `Pools` option.
3. Click on the `Create` button.
4. Enter a `Name` for the pool, and configure the options as required. For this
   guide we will leave the options as default.
5. Click on the `Create` button.

The Ceph Pool should now have been added to your tree view, under the Node where
you created it.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a hyper-converged Ceph cluster
on your Proxmox VE cluster. You can now use the Ceph cluster to store your VMs
and LXC containers, as well as configuring High Availability (HA) for your
Virtual Guests. A guide on Proxmox HA can be found below.
