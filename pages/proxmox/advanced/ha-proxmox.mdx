# Configuring a High Availability Proxmox Cluster

## Introduction

This guide is a simple one, it will walk you through the process of setting up
High Availability in a Proxmox cluster.

## What is High Availability?

High Availability (HA) is a feature that ensures that your virtual guests are
always available, even if a node in the cluster fails. When a node fails, the
virtual guests running on that node are automatically migrated to another node
in the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A Proxmox cluster with at least three nodes
  [Clustering Proxmox](/proxmox/advanced/clustering-proxmox)
- Shared storage between the nodes [Ceph Guide](/proxmox/advanced/ceph-proxmox)
- A network bridge for the HA network (recommended)

## Step by Step Guide

<Steps>

### Create a HA Group (Optional)

HA groups are used to group Virtual Guests together to ensure they are started
only on the nodes in the group.

1. Navigate to the `Datacenter` view.
2. Click on the `HA` drop-down menu, then click on the `Groups` option.
3. Click on the `Create` button.
4. Enter a name for the group in the `ID` field.
5. Select the nodes you want to add to the group.
6. You may also configure the `restricted`, and `nofailback` options as needed.
7. Click on the `Create` button.

### Configure HA Resources

1. Click on the `HA` drop-down menu
2. Under the `Resources` section, click on the `Add` button.
3. In the `VM` field, select the virtual guests you wish to be highly available.
4. In the `Group` field, select the HA group you created in the previous step.
5. Configure the `Max. Restart`, `Max. Relocate` and `Requested State` options
   as needed.
6. Then click on the `Add` button.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations, that's it! Promox HA is that simple to configure.
