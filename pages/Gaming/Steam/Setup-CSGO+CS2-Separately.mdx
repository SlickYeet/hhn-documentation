This is a tutorial about how to install a copy of CS:GO but also keep CS2 in your library so you don't need to install CS:GO or CS2 whenever you want to change games

# <strong>*Part One: Installing CS:GO*</strong>

</div>

In the Steam app, navigate to your library and to the Counter-Strike 2 page

Either right-click Counter-Strike 2 on the left (as shown) and select "properties" OR alternatively click the gear and select "properties" from there

That will bring you to Counter-Strike 2's General game settings page; go to "Betas" on the left

Under "Beta Participation" drop menu, select "csgo_legacy - Legacy Version of CS:GO"

Exit out of the settings page and now Steam should be prompting you to update the game so it may download all the CSGO files

#This WILL overwrite your current CS2 game, most of your settings should be saved but I recommend creating a autoexec file to save all of your settings and take a note of your video settings as those cannot be set by command-line

# <strong>*Part Two: Create a separate CSGO game entry on steam*</strong>

Browse to local files

It will bring you to this Screenshot

Navigate up to the "common" folder using one of the methods circled in the screenshot below and make a copy of the cs folder; you may rename it if you'd like

Here's an example of the folder being renamed, not crucial to the process but may make it easier for you to identify the game

Next on your Steam app go to Games > Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library

<Image src="images/csgo8.png" alt="CS2 page" width={500} height={500} />

Select "Browse"

<Image src="images/csgo9.png" alt="CS2 page" width={500} height={500} />

Copy the Directory for your CSGO file and paste it into the directory of the File Explorer page that opened when you clicked "Browse". Make sure to press enter

Search ".exe" in the search bar; select "csgo.exe"

You have just added CSGO back to your steam library; don't forgot to navigate back to cs2 and change beta selection back to "none"
