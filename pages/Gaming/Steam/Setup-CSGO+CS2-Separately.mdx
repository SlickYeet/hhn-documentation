This is a tutorial about how to install a copy of CS:GO but also keep CS2 in your library so you don't need to install CS:GO or CS2 whenever you want to change games

Part One: Installing CS:GO

In the Steam app, navigate to your library and to the Counter-Strike 2 page

Either right-click Counter-Strike 2 on the left (as shown) and select properties OR alternatively click the gear and select properties from there

That will bring you to Counter-Strike 2's  General game settings page; go to "Betas" on the left

Under "Beta Participation" drop menu, select "csgo_legacy - Legacy Version of CS:GO"

Exit out of the settings page and now Steam should be prompting you to update the game so it may download all the CSGO files

#This WILL overwrite your current CS2 game, most of your settings should be saved but I recommend creating a autoexec file to save all of your settings and take a note of your video settings as those cannot be set by command-line

Part Two: How to Create a separate CSGO folder and game file to add to your steam page so you don't need to keep redownloading it every time you want to switch games:

Browse to local files

It will bring you to Screenshot 

Navigate up to the common folder under steamapps and make a copy of the cs folder; you may rename it if you'd like

Next on your Steam app go to Games > Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library

Select Browse

Copy the Directory for your copy of the CSGO file and search ".exe" in the search bar; select "csgo.exe"

You have just added CSGO back to your steam library; don't forgot to navigate back to cs2 and change beta selection back to "none"
