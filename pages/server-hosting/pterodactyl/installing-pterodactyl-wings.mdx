## System Requirements

Wings require a Linux system capable of running Docker containers.

The easiest way to check if your machine is compatible is to type
`systemd-detect-virt`. If the output does not contain OpenVZ or LXC, your
machine should be compatible.

For more information, please visit the official
[Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#system-requirements).

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Installing Docker

To install Docker using a one-liner, run the following command:

<Callout type="default">
  This command may take a while to complete, depending on your internet
  connection and server speed.
</Callout>

```sh copy
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
```

If you prefer to manually install Docker, follow the official Docker
documentation for your OS:

- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-docker-ce)
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/#install-docker-ce)

<Callout type="default">
Check your Kernel

Some host providers may install modified versions of the Linux kernel, which
might not support important Docker features. To check your kernel, run the
command: `uname -r`. If your kernel is not supported, it will end in
`-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64` or `-xxxx-mod-std-ipv6-64`.

Check the official Pterodactyl guide for
[Kernel Modifications](https://pterodactyl.io/daemon/0.6/kernel_modifications.html).

</Callout>

### Start Docker on Boot

To start Docker when your system starts, run the following command:

```sh copy
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

**Enabling Swap**

Docker may be unable to set up swap space on most systems. To confirm this, run
`docker info` and look for a line that says `WARNING: No swap limit support`
near the bottom of the output.

**_NOTE:_** Swap is not required but recommended by the Pterodactyl Team if you
will be hosting for others.

To enable swap, open `/etc/default/grub` as the root user and find the line
starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Edit the value of `swapaccount` to
`1`, like so `swapaccount=1`.

Next, run sudo `update-grub` and `sudo reboot` or `systemctl reboot` to restart
the server and enable swap.

The following line is an example of what the line should look like:

```sh copy
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="swapaccount=1"
```

<Callout type="info">
 GRUB Configuration

Some Linux distros may ignore `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. In this case, use
`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead.

</Callout>

### Installing Wings

Ensure you have the required directory structure. Create the following directory
to ensure Wings works correctly:

```sh copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pterodactyl
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/wings "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/releases/latest/download/wings_linux_$([[ "$(uname -m)" == "x86_64" ]] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64")"
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/wings
```

<Callout type="warning">
 OVH/SYS Servers

If your server provider is OVH or SoYouStart, note that your primary drive space
might be allocated to `/home`, not `/` by default. In this case, consider using
`/home/daemon-data` for server data.

This can also be easily changed while creating the node.

</Callout>

### Configure

Once the installation of Wings and the required components is complete, you can
create a node on your previously installed Panel. Go to your Panel's
`Administrative View`, select `Nodes` on the left, and click `Create New`.

<Callout type="warning">
  When using SSL on your Panel, you must also use SSL for your Wings. To create
  a FQDN using [NPM](https://nginxproxymanager.com) for your Wings, follow this
  [guide](/server-hosting/npm).

**NOTE**: When creating a NPM host for your Wings, you must use http as the
`Scheme` and port `443`, when using SSL a `FQDN`.

**NOTE**: `WebSockets Support` must also be enabled on the Wings NPM host to
function correctly.

</Callout>

- Under the **Basic details** section, fill in the following fields:

  - `Name`: Enter a name for your node. This can be anything you like.
  - `Description`: Enter a description for your node. This can also be anything
    you like.
  - `Location`: This should reflect the physical location of your server, e.g.,
    `ca.bc.local`.
  - `FQDN`: Enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name of your server. This should be
    the domain name that points to you server&apos;s IP address.
  - `Communicate Over SSL`: When using a FQDN, this should be set to
    `Use SSL Connection`. If you are using an IP address, this should be
    disabled.
  - `Behind Proxy`: If you are using a proxy, this should be set to
    `Behind Proxy`, otherwise set it to `Not Behind Proxy`.

- Moving to the right side under the **Configuration** section, fill in the
  following fields:

  - `Daemon Server File Directory`: Leave this as the default value, unless you
    have a specific reason to change it.
  - `Total Memory`: Enter the total amount of memory available on your server.
  - `Memory Over-Allocation`: This is the amount of memory that can be
    over-allocated to servers. If you wish to with to not allow over-allocation,
    set the value to `0`. If you wish to not check for over-allocation, set the
    value to `-1`, otherwise set it to the desired amount.
  - `Total Disk Space`: Enter the total amount of disk space available on your
    server.
  - `Disk Over-Allocation`: The same as memory over-allocation, but for disk
    space.
  - `Daemon Port`: This is the port that Wings will use to communicate with the
    Panel. For SSL connections, and when using a `FQDN`, use `443`. For non-SSL
    connections, you may use the default value of `8080`.
  - `Daemon SFTP Port`: This is the port that Wings will use for SFTP
    connections. The default value is `2022`. We recommend using the default.

<Callout type="info">
  For more information on the configuration options, please read the notes on
  the screen in the Panel.
</Callout>

After creating a node, navigate to the `Configuration` tab. Copy the contents of
the code block and paste it into a new file called `config.yml` in
`/etc/pterodactyl`, then save it.

An alternative and easier way is to click on the `Generate Token` button on the
right of the screen and paste the command into your Wings&apos; terminal.

### Starting Wings

To start Wings, run the following command. This command starts the Wings process
in debug mode. Look through the logs and ensure there are no errors. Once you
have confirmed that everything is running smoothly, exit the process using
`CTRL+C`.

<Callout type="default">
  Your internet connection may cause the initial pull/start of Wings to be slow.
</Callout>

```sh copy
sudo wings --debug
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `--debug` flag is optional and is used in this step to ensure the correct
  installation of Wings.
</Callout>

### Daemonizing (using systemd)

Much like the pteroq.service we created in this
[guide](/server-hosting/pterodactyl/installing-pterodactyl-panel#2-create-queue-worker),
we will create a service for Wings.

This is done to run the service in the background. First, create a file called
`wings.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory:

```sh copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wings.service
```

Next, copy and paste the following block into the new file:

```sh copy showLineNumbers
[Unit]
Description=Pterodactyl Wings Daemon
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service
PartOf=docker.service

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/etc/pterodactyl
LimitNOFILE=4096
PIDFile=/var/run/wings/daemon.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/wings
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, run the following command to reload systemd and start the Wings service:

```sh copy
sudo systemctl enable --now wings
```

### Node Allocations

To connect to a node in-game, you must assign an Allocation to it. This is done
under the `Allocation` tab, still under Nodes, in the Node you created.

<Callout type="info">
 To find the IP of your Wings server, type `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`. The output is the IP used for the allocation. You may also use this command instead: `ip addr | grep "inet "`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">DO NOT use 127.0.0.1 for allocations.</Callout>

- `IP Address`: Enter the IP address of your server.
- `IP Alias`: This is optional and can be left blank, unless you have a `FQDN`
  for that specific IP, or multiple IPs.
- `Ports`: Enter the ports you wish to use for the server. The default port for
  Minecraft is `25565`.

For more information, please see the official
[Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#node-allocations)
