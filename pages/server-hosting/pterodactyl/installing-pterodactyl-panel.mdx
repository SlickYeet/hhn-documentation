# Installing Pterodactyl Panel

## Introduction

Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP,
React, and Go. It provides a robust platform for managing and deploying game
servers with ease, offering features such as a user-friendly interface, support
for various game servers, and secure and scalable architecture. This guide will
walk you through the steps to install and set up the Pterodactyl Panel on your
server, ensuring you have a solid foundation for managing your game servers.

For more detailed information and official documentation, visit the
[Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Install a Linux OS
  [Ubuntu Installation Guide](/linux/installing-ubuntu-server-24-04).
- (Optional) Setup a reverse network proxy [NPM Guide](/server-hosting/npm).
- Root access to your server is required to run and use the Pterodactyl Panel.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Dependency Installation

We will first begin by installing all of Pterodactyl's required dependencies.

1. Add `add-apt-repository` command:

   ```sh copy
   sudo apt -y install software-properties-common curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
   ```

2. Add additional repositories for `PHP`:

   ```sh copy
   LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php
   # or
   LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/nginx
   ```

3. Add `Redis` official APT repository:

   ```sh copy
   curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
   ```

4. MariaDB repo setup script:

   <Callout type="default">
     MariaDB repo setup script can be skipped on Ubuntu 22.04+
   </Callout>

   ```sh copy
   curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash
   ```

5. Update repositories list:

   ```sh copy
   apt update
   ```

6. Install dependencies:

   ```sh copy
   sudo apt -y install php8.1 php8.1-{common,cli,gd,mysql,mbstring,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip} mariadb-server nginx tar unzip git redis-server
   ```

### Installing Composer

Composer is required for dependency management in PHP. It will be used to ship
all code needed to operate the panel.

```sh copy
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### Download Files

Before we can download the files, we need a place to store them.

```sh copy
mkdir -p /var/www/pterodactyl
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
```

Once you've created the necessary directories for Pterodactyl, we can proceed to
download the files.

```sh copy
curl -Lo panel.tar.gz https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz
tar -xzvf panel.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

### Installation

Now that we have all the files needed, we can configure the base Panel.

#### Database Configuration

<Callout type="info">
The following steps will show you how to configure a database on the Panel.

Follow the same steps below, on a dedicated database server, and change the
necessary DB\_\* environmental variables for a non-local database.

</Callout>

```sh copy
mysql -u root -p
```

**_NOTE:_** Remember to change 'yourPassword' below to be a unique password.

```sh copy
CREATE USER 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE panel;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON panel.* TO 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

#### Creating a Database Host for Nodes

<Callout type="warning">
  You should change the username and password below to something unique.
</Callout>

```sh copy
CREATE USER 'pterodactyluser'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'pterodactyluser'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```

#### Environment Configuration

```sh copy
cp .env.example .env
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Only run the below command for first-time installations of this Panel:
</Callout>

```sh copy
php artisan key:generate --force
```

<Callout type="error">
  Back up and keep your `.env` file safe after environment configuration is
  complete.
</Callout>

Now we will populate the environmental variables inside `.env` via the following
commands.

<Callout type="info">
  Running the following commands will prompt you to answer several questions.
  You may check out the
  [.env.example](/server-hosting/pterodactyl/example-env#base-env-setup) as a
  reference for the following questions.
</Callout>

```sh copy
php artisan p:environment:setup
php artisan p:environment:database
```

<Callout type="warning">
(NOT RECOMMENDED) To use PHP's internal mailing system, select "mail".

For a custom SMTP server, such as Gmail, select "smtp".

</Callout>

See reference
[.env.example](/server-hosting/pterodactyl/example-env#mail-env-setup).

```sh copy
php artisan p:environment:mail
```

### Database Setup

It is time to set up the database contents. The command below will create the
database tables and all the base Nests and Eggs that come with Pterodactyl.

<Callout type="info">
  The following command may take several minutes to complete, depending on your
  machine. Please be patient.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  Please DO NOT exit the process until it is completed.
</Callout>

```sh copy
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

#### Add The First User

Someone has to manage the Panel. The command below will create the very first
user. This user should be made an administrator of the Panel. See reference
[.env.example](/server-hosting/pterodactyl/example-env#user-env-setup).

```sh copy
php artisan p:user:make
```

#### Set Permissions

The last step of the installation is to set the correct permissions on the Panel
files.

The following commands will change the owner of all the files and directories
inside the pterodactyl directory.

<Callout type="default">
  Please read the command comments to find the command applicable to your
  environment.
</Callout>

```sh copy
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS)
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pterodactyl/*
```

```sh copy
# If using NGINX on CentOS
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pterodactyl/*
```

```sh copy
# If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pterodactyl/*
```

### Queue Listeners

For a more detailed explanation of queue listeners and what they do, see the
official
[Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#queue-listeners).

#### Crontab Configuration

First, we need to edit crontab. For anyone who has never used crontab, crontab
is a simple way to schedule tasks inside a Unix operating system. To edit
crontab, run the following command.

**_NOTE:_** You may be prompted to choose a text editor. The simplest way to
edit a file such as crontab would be `nano` or `gedit`. However, experienced
users are welcome to use `vi/vim`.

```sh copy
sudo crontab -e
```

Once inside crontab, append the following line at the bottom of the file.

```sh copy
* * * * * php /var/www/pterodactyl/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

<Callout type="info">
To save and exit nano, press `CTRL+S` and then `CTRL+X`.

If you would like to view the contents of the crontab without opening the editor
use `sudo crontab -l`

</Callout>

#### Create Queue Worker

Next, we will create a new systemd worker to keep the previous process running
continuously in the background. For more information, please visit the official
[Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#create-queue-worker).

First, create a file called `pteroq.service` under the directory
`/etc/systemd/system` like so:

```sh copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pteroq.service
```

Next, copy and paste the following block into the newly created file.

```sh copy showLineNumbers
# Pterodactyl Queue Worker File
# ----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Pterodactyl Queue Worker
After=redis-server.service

[Service]
# On some systems the user and group might be different.
# Some systems use `apache` or `nginx` as the user and group.
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/pterodactyl/artisan queue:work --queue=high,standard,low --sleep=3 --tries=3
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Lastly, you need to enable and start the `redis-server` and the `pteroq.service`
we just created.

```sh copy
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
sudo systemctl enable --now pteroq.service
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have completed the installation of the Pterodactyl Panel.
You can now move on to configuring the webserver to access the Panel and start
creating servers to play with friends.

Happy Hosting!
