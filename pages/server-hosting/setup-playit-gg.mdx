# Playit.gg Setup

## Introduction

The Playit.gg platform is a powerful tool for hosting and managing game servers.
With Playit.gg, you can easily set up and configure game servers on your
machine. This guide will walk you through the process of installing and setting
up Playit.gg on your server. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- A stable internet connection
- Root access to your server (Recommended)
- `Linux Server`: If you do not already have a Linux Server setup you can follow
  [this guide](/linux/installing-ubuntu-server-24-04.mdx), to do so.

<Callout type="info">
  You may also run the playit service on macOS or Windows. However, we will not
  cover this process here. For more information visit
  [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/download).
</Callout>

## Step by Step Guide

<Steps>
### Create an Account

Head to [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) make an account then navigate to the
`download` tab.

### Install the `playit` Package

Once on the download page, copy the code inside the
`Debian Install Script (apt-get)` box then paste it into your terminal.

<Callout type="info">
  If you get a warning in apt about playit's repo, please visit [playit.gg
  GitHub
  repo](https://github.com/playit-cloud/playit-agent?tab=readme-ov-file#the-playit-program)
  before running `apt install playit`
</Callout>

```sh copy
sudo apt install gpg -y
curl -SsL https://playit-cloud.github.io/ppa/key.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/playit.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/playit.gpg] https://playit-cloud.github.io/ppa/data ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playit-cloud.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install playit
```

After you have installed the `playit.gg` package, run the following commands to
start the service and setup your agent:

```sh copy
systemctl enable --now playit.service
playit setup
```

You will be prompted with a claim URL which you need to open in your browser.
Copy or `CTRL+Click` the URL to open in your browser.

Once you opened the URL you are guided through the process of setting up your
agent. Follow the steps until you get to the `Create agent` button.

We suggest leaving all defaults, for a plug n&apos; play experience. However,
users are encurraged to customize the agent to their needs.

### Create Your First Tunnel

Step 4 of the guided setup process present the user with a button. Click the
`Create Tunnel` button to start creating your first tunnel.

<Callout type="info">
  Playit.gg's free tier does NOT include the `Use Dedicated IP` option. But in
  my experience the free shared IP does not change, and therefore can easily be
  mapped to a domain name using something like [Cloudflare
  DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
</Callout>

Once the Add Tunnel model is open, select your prefered `IP option`, `Region`
and `Tunnel Type`. I will be using the `Use Shared IP` option, the
`Global Anycast (free)` Region and the `Minecraft Java (game)` Tunnel Type.

<Callout type="default">
  Please check with your applications requirements for the appropriate `Tunnel
  Type`.
</Callout>

Finally click `Add Tunnel`.

<Callout type="info">
  At this point you may also close out of the playit setup, using `CTRL+C`. The
  service will continue running the background.
</Callout>

### Configure Your Playit Tunnel

After you have added your tunnel, you can configure it if you wish. It should
work without further configuration, but since I like specificity I will
configure it more.

Under the `Tunnels` tab you will find all of your tunnels. Select the tunnel you
just created.

At the top of the screen you will find a `domain name` and an `IP address` and
port. You can use either to connect to you tunnel and in turn the server which
your agent and application is running on, from within game.

When scrolling down you will find the `Update Local Address` section. Here you
can edit the local address of your server.

<Callout type="info">
  Since I have select the `Minecraft Java (game)` `Tunnel Type` the default
  values for `Local address` and `Local Port` are set to 127.0.0.1 and 25565.
  Which are the localhost loopback IP of your server, and the default Minecraft
  port, respectively.
</Callout>

I will set the `Local Address` value to the local network IP address of my
server. I will keep the `Local Port` value default since I plan to run a
Minecraft server.

After you have configured the values to your liking, click the `Update` button.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

You're all set! Congratulations, you've successfully set up playit.gg on your
Linux Server. You are now ready to host game servers, and other services, from
you local network while looking like a professional service provider!

## Next Steps

For your next steps we recommend using the [NPM guide](/server-hosting/npm) to
setup a reverse network proxy. This paired with a Cloudflare domain name will
elevate your server hosting to another level.

Happy Hosting!
