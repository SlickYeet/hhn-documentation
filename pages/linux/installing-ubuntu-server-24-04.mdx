## Introduction

Ubuntu Server is a free, open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It is
designed to be used as a server operating system and is used by many
organizations worldwide. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of
installing Ubuntu Server 24.04, however the steps are be similar for other
versions of Ubuntu Server.

## Prerequisites

  of free disk space.
  [System Specs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/system-requirements)
- A bootable USB drive with Ubuntu Server 24.04 ISO image. You can download the
  official ubuntu server ISO [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). If you
  are unsure how to create a bootable USB drive, you can follow our guide on
  [creating a bootable USB drive using Rufus](/bootable-usb-drive/creating-a-bootable-usb-drive-using-rufus)
  or
